    A new option "-f" is added to command the SysLink daemon
    to run as a foreground process. This change is required if
    the syslink_daemon.out is running as a init.rc service and
    need to be restarted automatically when it crashed or was
    killed.
    
    Example Usage:
    ./syslink_daemon.out -f <SysM3image> <AppM3image>
    This will force the daemon to run as foreground process.

    SysLink: Daemons - Strip the commandline till the last slash
    
    This patch fixes an issue with detecting multiple instances of
    the SysLink Daemon if they are launched from different paths.
    
    The initial assumption was, daemon will always be executed from
    the same directory. But in reality this may not be the case. It
    can be executed from any directory and in that case the current
    implementation would fail the detection test. For eg., first time
    if the daemon is executed from /system/bin folder, the entry in
    the procfs will be ./syslink_daemon.out, and second time if it is
    executed from /system patg, it will be ./bin/syslink_daemon.out,
    and the current implementation considers it as a different
    executable. This patch fixes this issue by stripping the command
    line upto the last '/' and then comparing the rest.
    
    A KW fix, sprintf replaced with snprintf for boundary checking,
    is also added.

    SysLink: ProcMgr - Fixed Tiler block lookup
    
    This patch fixes a bug with TILER block finder code in
    _SysLinkMemUtils_findNode().  When a buffer is to be
    freed, the lookup code was selecting the wrong block.
    The bug manifested because there is difference in the
    stride of a buffer on A9 side virtual address and
    Ducati-side virtual address representation of a TILER
    buffer. For 2D buffers, the A9-side mmap is a linear
    mmap of the pages that comprise the 2D buffer, whereas
    on Ducati, the VA is the same as the actual TILER SSPtr
    address. The original lookup used the Ducati VA
    address, but performed address comparison as if using
    an A9 VA, and hence giving out a wrong block sometimes.
    
    SysLinkMemUtils_DAtoVA() is now a stub that always
    returns NULL.  It is necessary to disable this function
    due to the changes to the block lookup.  It is likely
    to be removed in the future unless a need for it is
    found.

    SysLink: RCM - List protection for RCM
    
    Modified RcmServer to ensure all accesses to its linked
    lists have gate protection.  Critical sections are
    protected by the server Gate.  All List instances of
    RcmServer are assigned separate gates.  Lists used by
    RcmClient use the RcmClient's gate.

    SysLink: Utils - Remove system gate from List module
    
    The List module (utils/List.c) is using the system gate
    for protection along with an instance specific gate supplied
    during creation.  There is no need for both, so the system
    gate is being removed.  This prevents possible freezes if
    the instance gate is set to the system gate.  Lists will
    not use a gate if one is not assigned during creation.

    After a select returns successfully, the ProcMgr_waitForMultipleEvents
    call unregisters all the events that were passed in rather than only the
    one which got triggered. This does not rely on the application to close
    all the syslink drivers between sucessive use cases to prevent the memory
    leak. This is the common use with applications currently as the de-init
    IPC stack after each video/image usecase. The kernel closes the the syslink

    SysLink: Daemons - Prevent multiples instances.
    
    This is a preliminary implementation of a feature to
    prevent running mulitple instances of the Syslink daemon.
    The detection is done by parsing the procfs to see if
    there is more than one process with the name of the
    Syslink daemon.  If it finds another instance running,
    it will exit immediately.

    SysLink: Daemons - Update Trace Daemon for LogCat
    
    This patch adds logcat support to syslink_trace_daemon.
    The changes to the deamon include:
    * By default the traces are printed with Osal_printf.
      If the -l option is used with "stdout" as the file
      name, then output will be printed to stdout even
      on Android.  The -l option with a valid file name
      works as it did previously.
    * The daemon now updates every .5 seconds.  The
      sleep(1) call was changed to usleep(500000).
    * The thread function was rewritten to print traces by
      line instead of by char.
    * Each thread now runs the same thread function.  Thread
      specific data is passed to the thread function in a
      new structure.
    * Trace buffer data is copied to a scratch buffer that
      is slightly larger than the trace buffer where it is
      modified and printed.

    SysLink: Utils - Make LOG_TAG customizable
    
    These changes allow LOG_TAG to be modified in any executable.
    The LOG_TAG macro variable sets the tag seen when printing
    traces to the Android logging system (logcat).  When SysLink
    is built under Android, Osal_printf() output is redirected to
    Android logging functions, i.e. LOGD, if the macro
    SYSLINK_LOGCAT_ENABLE is defined at the linking stage. These
    functions use LOG_TAG to prefix an identifier to the output.
    
    To set the tag for a file:
       #include <OsalPrint.h>
       #if defined (HAVE_ANDROID_OS)
       #define LOG_TAG "something"
       #endif
    
    Any Osal_printf calls following the #define will be prefixed
    with "something".
    
    The SYSLINK_DIRECT_LOGD macro, if defined when compiling
    any sources, will replace any Osal_printf calls with LOGD.
    When this macro is not defined, Osal_printf() is still called,
    but is now configurable.  The Osal_configPrint() function
    can be used to redirect the traces to LogCat selectively.
    To redirect these traces, do:
    
       Osal_printConfig (Osal_printToLogCat);
       ... other function calls, code ...
       Osal_printConfig (Osal_printToConsole);
    
    Default behavior is to output traces to the console.
    
    For non-Android builds the output from Osal_printf() remains
    directed through stdout.

    SysLink: Daemons - Enhance to recover from M3 WatchDog events
    
    The SysLink daemon is enhanced to listen for WatchDog events on the
    M3 processors, and reload the M3 processors in case of an error. Some
    heavy code formatting cleanup changes are also incorporated.
    
    The current kernel WatchDog logic is integrated with the SysLink
    IPU_PM hibernation logic, and cannot distinguish whether a WatchDog
    has occured on SysM3 or AppM3, and would notify both in case of one.
    However, the daemon code is listening to both the cores still, to
    account for the case that AppM3 may not be loaded always.
    
    The pthread termination sequence has been modified to clean up more
    graciously.  The pthread_kill calls have been removed from the signal
    handler, and moved to the main thread. The signal handler posts the
    semaphore that would be used as a trigger to kill the threads from
    main thread.

    SysLink: ProcMgr - Add userspace DEH framework
    
    DEH exists in SysLink kernel space and apprises remote cores when a

    error recovery can take place.
    
    This patch adds the userspace interface for DEH module, called the
    ProcDEH module, so that handles to devh devices can be opened/closed.
    Additionally userspace can also register with the device for sys error
    events.

    SysLink: RCM - Improve argument checking for RCM API
    
    1. Some of the the API's in RCM module had been missing the NULL
       check for function arguments(pointers), and those checks have been
       added to take care of the NULL pointers.
    2. Fixed one compiler warning in RcmClient module.
    3. Fixed minor trace errors in RcmServer module.

    SysLink: Daemons - Add thread join protection in SysLink Daemon
    
    MMU fault thread is exiting by posting the semaphore, but before
    the kernel is cleaning up the thread resources the thread is
    recreated with the same handle since the kernel didn't delete
    the thread yet. After several iterations, it will return a
    failure EAGAIN when trying to create the thread.
    
    So apparently after several iterations, system is running out
    of resources or PTHREAD_THREADS_MAX is reached. To avoid this,
    the thread handle is set to NULL before passing to pthread_create,
    pthread_join was added to ensure the termination of the already
    created thread before creating a new one, also now a check for
    pthread_create was included.

    SysLink: RCM - Fix corner cases in RCM Worker Thread Pool design
    
    Fixes have been made to the following corner cases in the current
    RCM worker thread pool design:
    1. The worker thread, upon processing a message with a specific
       job id, looks up the corresponding job stream and fetches the
       next packet. If this packet belongs to a different pool, the
       thread places it on the corresponding pool's readyQueue but
       still has ownership of it, and loops back to process it leading
       to a race condition. Also, if the packet belongs to the same
       pool, it proceeds to  process this message without picking
       up a message from the pool's readyQueue, thereby starving
       the messages on the readyQueue. The fix is to put the packet
       onto the corresponding readyQueue and wait for the thread to be
       signalled again, thus preserving the order of messages on the
       readyQueue.
    2. The above execution flow also results in a packet being
       unhandled, if the worker thread is signalled to terminate, after
       it fetches the packet. The same fix above will also handle this
       orphaned message.
    3. Any unprocessed messages on a pool's readyQueue are lost in the
       current implementation when the server is being deleted. The fix
       loops through these messages and sents them back to the client
       after the pool's threads are all terminated.
    4. If the server thread picks up a message, and is signalled to
       terminate at the same time, the termination is taking precedence
       over the picked up message resulting in a unprocessed message.
       The current fix is to process the message before exiting the
       server thread function.
    
    Messages left over on the server MessageQ (and any the client has
    added while the deletion is in progress) after the server thread
    has terminated are currently not handled, and needs to be fixed
    in the future.

    SysLink: RCM - Enhance current RCM design
    
    The following two major RCM design enhancements are introduced
    with this patch:
    1. RCM Server Worker Pool design
    The current RCM design has only a single server thread which
    processes all the incoming messages sequentially. The RCM Server
    Worker Thread Pool design creates a RCM Server with multiple pools
    of worker thread. This allows users to prioritize each call to
    RCM server. If you create an RcmServer instance using just the
    default values, the default pool will not have any threads. All
    messages sent to the default pool will be processed by the server
    thread function (in-band processing). The RCM server allows for
    creation static worker thread pools during create phase. Dynamic
    creation of worker thread pools is not supported at this time.
    
    On the client side, RcmClient_alloc() will initialize the message
    with "poolId = RcmClient_DEFAULTPOOLID" (this is default value)
    thus addressing the message to the default pool. The user can
    change the poolId to send the message to a particular pool. When
    the server thread function receives this message, it checks
    the poolId to route the message to correct worker thread pool
    or process the message itself (in-band processing). Additionally,
    the client can acquire and assign a jobId to the RCM messages.
    RCM messages sent with the same job stream id are guaranteed to
    be processed serially. The default value for job stream is set to
    RcmClient_DISCRETEJOBID, and these are processed by one of the
    respective pool's worker threads.
    
    2. Error Checking on uni-directional RCM messages
    The RCM Client now has an error queue to which all the failed
    RcmClient_execCmd (formerly RcmClient_execNoReply) RCM messages
    are returned to. The user can check for these messages using the
    new RcmClient_checkForError API. The RcmClient_checkForError API
    returns the same statuses as the regular RcmClient_exec API.
    
    The patch also includes SysLink 2.0 userspace code compliant
    formatting changes.

    SysLink: Samples - Adding delay to simulate system suspend in resources sample
    
    The resources test simulate System suspend using ioctl functions that
    sends the suspend-resume messages to Ducati. Suspend message will trigger
    hibernation on Ducati which expects to be rested by A9. In System suspend,
    Ducati is indeed reset but not in the ioctl path. If the resume message is
    sent immediately after the Suspend path, this will interrupt Ducati in the
    middle of the saving context routine which is a high priority Swi. The
    resume message will be enqueued to be attended later in a lower Swi. The
    high priority saving context swi continues then and finishes calling WFI,
    so Ducati can only attend other tasks until reset or a mbox message arrives.
    Since the resume message has been already received but enqueued in a low
    priority Swi, this is not attended until another mbox message arrives or
    Ducati is reset.
    
    In the resources test Ducati is not reset, so if we add a delay we assure
    the resume message is sent when Ducati is already in WFI and not in the
    middle of the high priority Saving context Swi avoiding the above described
    issue.

    SysLink: Daemons - Dump context and stack info upon crash
    
    Crash dump utility helps programmers debug Ducati crashes. At
    the time of crash useful state info is stored by BIOS and can
    be dumped to a pre-configured memory region. When A9 gets
    notified upon an mmu fault through the mmu_fault_isr, mmu_fault
    handler prints the context information (internal registers,
    offending thread type, handle etc.) and thread/task/interrupt
    stack before starting resouce cleanup.
    
    With whole_program_debug builds the stack is very small
    or non-existent. For larger stacks, use debug build for
    ducati images.

    SysLink: Samples - DMM-add MMU fault generation test case
    
    Add the test case to generate mmu fault and use it to verify the
    mmu fault recovery mechanism.
    Way to run this test case is
    
    	- Load the Syslink image using daemon
    	- Run the dmm test case
    		./dmm_deamontest.out 7 1
    
    	- On killing the test case process daemon should reload the image
    
    This is the first test case in the set of mmu fault tests planned for
    near future.

    Add the capability for listening more events in

    NOTE: This samples is useful as an example how the APPs can
    register for events like MMUFAULT and PROC_STOP. Because in
    those cases the APPs need to close their handle and wait until
    the daemon is restored.

    Added DMM test cases with the daemon option. These test cases
    do not load images by themselves, so load the images using daemon
    before starting the test.
    
    Following Tests are added:
    Test 1 - DMM buffer:
            Usage: ./dmm_daemontest.out 1 <Proc#> <Buffer Size> <NumIterations>
    Test 2 - Tiler use buffer:
            Usage: ./dmm_daemontest.out 2 <Proc#> <Buffer Size> <NumIterations>
    Test 3 - Map Test:
            Usage: ./dmm_daemontest.out 3 <Proc#> <Buffer Size> <NumIterations>
    Test 4 - Flush memory Negetive Test:
            Usage: ./dmm_daemontest.out 4 <Proc#> <Buffer Size>
    Test 5 - Map with no Unmap Test:
            Usage: ./dmm_daemontest.out 5 <Proc#> <Buffer Size> <num_of_buffers>
    Test 6 - Map IO buffer Test:
            Usage: ./dmm_daemontest.out 6 <Proc#> <Buffer Size> <num_of_buffers>
    
    Running the sample usage:
    	Load the images:
    	  ./syslink_daemon.out /binaries/Notify_MPUSYS_reroute_Test_Core0.xem3
    	 	/binaries/MemAllocServer_MPUAPP_Test_Core1.xem3
    	Run the Test case:
    	  ./dmm_daemontest.out
    
    These test cases are similar to the usebuffer tests cases in SyslinkTilerTest
    case.

    SysLink: ProcMgr - Incorrect proc id passed to ProcMMU close
    
    This patch fixes an issue where an invalid procId is passed
    to ProcMMU_close from the ProcMgr_close function.  When
    ProcMMU_close is called, a pointer that has been freed is
    dereferenced to get the procId.  This results in the procId
    being 0 when ProcMMU_close is called.
    
    This patch saves the procId before freeing the pointer and
    uses the saved procId value to call ProcMMU_close so that
    the correct procId is passed.

    SysLink: ProcMgr - Fix memory mapping leaks
    
    ProcMgr_open and ProcMgr_attach API are used in mapping the processor
    related entries into the user-space. The mapping is done in one of the
    API based on whether the kernel proc_mgr module has been attached or not
    previously. In the case of the application running alongside the daemon,
    the mappings are done in ProcMgr_open, but ProcMgr_attach resets the
    memEntries count thereby leading to a memory unmap leak in ProcMgr_close.
    This patch fixes this defect by introducing separate counters to keep
    track of entries opened during _open or _attach and use them to do the
    unmapping in the respective _close or _detach functions.

    Without this functionality everything that is memory mapped inside
    the host process will remain mapped after de-initialization.

    SysLink: ProcMgr - Move ProcMMU_open call to ProcMgr Open
    
    The call to open ProcMMU is moved to ProcMgr_open. Without this,
    the handle to IOMMU is invalid since previously it was opened only
    during the Load time.
    
    So one would see the DMM test cases fail if the Application is built
    with no loader option, or run with the SysLink Daemon.

    SysLink: ProcMgr - Fix the cache function direction argument
    
    The Cache flush and invalidate argument has to match for the buffer.
    The Kernel internally stores the flush direction when a cache flush
    is called, and when invalidate is called on the same buffer it checks
    for the previous flush function direction and if they don't match the
    cache invalidate function fails.

    SysLink: ProcMgr - Remove reset sequence from ProcMMU
    
    The reset sequence is implemented in IOMMU kernel module. So no need of
    doing this reset sequence in user-space ProcMMU module.
    This patch requies the equivalent patch in Kernel that has IOMMU HWMOD
    implementation.

    Added reset for RST3 to ProcMMU_close so that resets are in proper state for
    next run.  Also moved ProcMMU_close to be called after CMD_PROCMGR_STOP.
    
    In ProcMMU_open, if the resets are found to not be in the proper state, it
    sends a reset for RST1, RST2 and RST3, but doesn't wait for it to complete
    before continuing.  ProcMMU_open should wait for the reset completion before
    continuing or the subsequent de-asserts may not work properly.

    SysLink: Daemons - Create default HeapBufMPs for use by DOMX
    
    Two default HeapBufMPs are created within the SysLink daemon with
    the new SysLink code. There are no heaps that are created by default
    within SysMgr, and the daemon creates and registers the heaps to be used
    by all other applications. Heap0 is used by TILER and Heap1 will be
    registered for usage by DOMX Clients.

    SysLink: Samples - Increase HeapBufMP number of blocks for RCM stress tests
    
    RCM Stress tests need a lot of messages, and the associated HeapBufMP
    needs to have a lot of blocks available for allocation.  Previously
    it was set to only 4 blocks, which was sufficient for the ordinary
    tests that do not have as much communication.

    using the new ProcMgr sequences to deal with both cores, the creation of
    the HeapBufMP for usage by RCM, cleanup to remove non-SysMgr code,
    argument-checking during sample invocation, a trace addition for automatic

    SysLink: Samples - Update RCM sample to use the latest RCM interface
    
    RCM single test samples have been updated to work with the latest RCM
    interface and the latest SysLink codebase. The samples have been updated to
    work with both SysM3 and AppM3. The following are the significant changes:
    
    - Added two ProcMgr handles to address SysM3 & AppM3.
    - Added ProcMgr_attach & ProcMgr_getState APIs.
    - Remove the SharedRegion entry addition. This is automatically done during
      SysMgr synchronization.
    - Added a custom HeapBufMP creation to be used for MessageQ msg allocations.
      The heaps are no longer created within SysMgr.
    - Cleaned up the code to remove the non-SysMgr variant.
    - Added checks for parameter validation.
    - The coding style has been adjusted, and the small sample headers have been
      deleted.
    - Added a trace to support automatic execution by TITAN framework.

    function is modified to browse for this symbol through the loader
    and pass it into the driver.
    
    This patch requires support from Loader to be able to browse
    symbols.

    SysLink: IPC - Enable calling kernel Ipc_setup from userspace
    
    Ipc_setup function is customized so that the initial Ipc_setup on
    the kernel-side can be made from the user-side. The individual
    setup call of different modules cannot be used to override the kernel
    configuration, as the kernel-side would have already configured it.

    SysMgr module is synched up for SysLink-2.0 version. This version
    incorporates changes for improved ease of programming for the user.
    
    SysMgr module is now renamed to a new Ipc module to reflect the name
    properly on both MPU & Slave processors. The functionality of SysMgr
    remains mostly the same.
    
    The following are the main changes specific to this module.
    1. All 'SysMgr' files have been renamed to the corresponding 'Ipc' files.
       information is captured in _Ipc.h and a common header file between
       MPU & Ducati, ti/ipc/Ipc.h
    
    TODO:
    Ipc.c
    1. Retained Ipc_loadcallback, Ipc_startcallback and Ipc_stopcallbacks.
       Need to get rid of these and move this logic into Ipc_control. May
       need to add the check for procId before sending down the ioctl. Also
       need MultiProc usage rather than #defined PROC_ID limit check.
    2. Define the commands appropriately.
    3. Rename the files to Ipc.
    4. Move it within Ipc folder.
    
    IpcDrvDefs.c
    1. Remove the custom defines for load, start and stop callbacks.
    2. Modify the DrvCmds structure to reflect the above change.
    4. Need the IPC_BASECMD change in IpcCmdBase.h
    
    IpcUsr.h
    1. Remove the load, start and stop callback definitions.

    SysLink: IPC - HeapMemMP module added from SysLink 2.0
    
    SysLink 2.0 contains a new module, HeapMemMP.  This patch
    adds that module to our SysLink code base.
    
    HeapMemMP differs from HeapBuf/HeapBufMP in that it allows
    allocation for variable sizes.  It is designed for use when the
    size of allocation is not known beforehand or when there is
    a large variation in expected alloc sizes.
    
    HeapMemMP includes the various API/module changes that are
    common to all modules in SysLink 2.0 such as:
    - Status definitions follow the format HeapMemMP_E_<status>.
    - The HeapMemMP_Params_init function does not take a handle
      argument.
    - HeapMemMP_open opens an existing HeapMemMP by name only.
    - HeapMemMP_openByAddr opens an existing HeapMemMP based on
      shared memory address.
    - BSD License adoption.
    
    Also, we have retained the use of an enum for IOCTL codes
    in HeapMemMPDrvDefs.h.

    Instead of directly using the testlib.c under tiler. This follows

    SysLink: d2c - Moved d2c from TILER userspace to SysLink
    
    Moved the d2c directory under tiler-userspace to be under syslink.
    The new directory structure looks like this:
        userspace-syslink
        + bridge
        + syslink
           + api
           + daemons

           + samples
           + scripts
        + target
    
    The build files have been updated so that both Android build and
    Autobuild will build d2c along with the rest of SysLink.

    SysLink: RCM - Post to semaphore twice for Android workaround
    
    Android's sem_destroy throws an EBUSY error on a semaphore that is has
    no threads waiting on it in RcmServer.  To resolve this, RcmServer posts
    to it twice. This allows the cleanup to proceed.  This should not break
    RcmServer on Linux because the semaphore is used only once (one pair of
    pend/post).
    
    The second semaphore post is added conditionally, and only gets executed
    for Android.

    SysLink: Build - Support for Android build
    
    Added Android makefiles (Android.mk) to project tree.  All APIs, Daemons,
    and SysMgr-enabled samples are included in the Android build.  No changes
    to Linux Makefiles, as Android makefiles are completely independent and
    have a different name.
    
    Differences between Android and Linux builds:
    - Android makefiles are called Android.mk
    - Android makefiles are built as part of the Android file system, not
      independently.  Thus to build SysLink Userspace for Android, the project
      tree must first be integrated into the main Android build.  In the top-
      level makefile, the path relative to the top of the main build tree is
      defined as TI_SYSLINK_TOP.
    - Android does not tolerate circular dependencies between libraries.  We
      have such a dependency between SysMgr and ProcMgr.  This is resolved in
      the Android build by including source files of both modules in SysMgr's
      makefile.  ProcMgr is not built as a standalone module in Android.
    - Android assumes that SysLink Userspace is under
           (ANDROID ROOT)/hardware/ti/omap4/syslink
      This is the equivalent of userspace-syslink/syslink.

    SysLink: Daemons - Trace Daemon Semaphore for exclusive print permission
    
    Added a semaphore to Trace Daemon that is shared by the SysM3 thread and
    the AppM3 thread.  Each thread must wait on the semaphore before printing
    and release it afterwards.  This ensures that only one thread is printing
    at once and avoids garbled output.

    SysLink: Daemons - Fixed signal handling and cleanup
    
    This patch fixes two bugs.
    
    First, it removes the call to exit() in the signal handler.  Calling exit()
    caused the problem of shutting the application down abruptly, without giving
    the daemon thread a chance to finish cleanup.  With this change, the daemon
    can finish cleanup and exit by returning from main().
    
    Second, it removes an extra AppM3 usage flag (Bool appM3Client) in ipc_setup()
    that was masking the global flag.  The variable should be global because it is
    being used by multiple functions.  The local flag prevented ipc_setup() from
    communicating the AppM3 status to the other functions, interfering with the
    cleanup process.  Previously undetected because the exit handler was not
    working so it never reached the cleanup phase.

    SysLink: ProcMgr - Handle invalid loader return value
    
    ProcMgr_load was checking the status of load_executable by checking prog_handle.
    If it was null then it was indicative of a failure.  However, if SysM3 load
    succeeded and AppM3 image was not found, prog_handle would still have the old
    valid value.  load_executable returns -1 in that case.  So now ProcMgr_load also
    checks for the return value of load_executable.

    SysLink: ProcMgr - Turn off a ProcMgr_delete failure trace
    
    ProcMgr_delete API is called as part of ProcMgr_destroy from
    SysMgr_destroy. As such, this API is always called from an
    application calling SysMgr_destroy. This results in a misleading
    trace statement print when the application is run alongside the
    Syslink daemon. This trace is therefore converted from a
    GT_setFailureReason to a regular GT_trace to minimize confusion
    to end-users.

    SysLink-Bridge: Build - Autotools build file updates
    
    The current Autotools build system in Syslink and Bridge
    is not capable of building properly other than from the
    local source root. This patch updates the build to remove
    these restrictions to ease the integration a the system
    level.
    
    The following are the main changes:
    1) support for pkg-config
    2) fix issues when building from a directory other than the src root
    3) support to properly install header files

    SysLink: Daemons - Trace Buffer Daemon boundary cond. crash fix.
    
    The readpointer was going past the memory that was memory mapped
    as the first 8 bytes are used for read pointer and the write
    pointer and the actual trace buffer starts from base_address + 8
    hence the wrapping condition should also take care of this additional
    8 bytes.

    Added SYSLINK_USE_SYSMGR flag to compile the ProcMgr

    This is required, since we have to call Proc_start()

    would trigger calling the above mentioned callbacks
    within the Proc_Start()/Stop() calls. This is not

    SysLink: RCM - Recipient structure missing elem
    
    The Recipient structure definition in RcmClient.c was missing the member
    List_Elem elem.  This member allows the Recipient object to be used in a List.
    In the context of RcmClient, it would be used to create a recipient list for
    other threads to signal, if no message for the current recipient was found.
    But since the struct was missing elem, it could not be correctly used with List.
    Previously this did not cause problems because we did not test multiple threads
    on one client, so we did not have to switch between recipients with blocking
    RCM calls.
